      <p>I've always loved computers and <strong>video games</strong>. (PC gamer for life). Besides that, I'm into the usual awesome things Portland has to offer: media that I enjoy and food that pleases my palette. The only thing outside of coding that I continuously strive to improve upon is being a decent person. I spend <em>a lot of time</em> considering the social and moral aspects of life and always try to keep an open mind.</p>
      <h3>Why I chose programming</h3>
      <p>I've always loved tech. When I wasn't biking around with my friends as a kid I was either playing video games or opening up / messing with my desktop computer. I broke it a few times but always managed to fix it again. Later on I ended up going into art as a professional interest, a family tradition, but I continued to play around with computers and learn applications like Photoshop and Illustrator. In college I took a basic web design class and fell in love with the more hands-on computer work. I slowly inched my way into more coding, eventually trying out basic JavaScript. After some success, I felt confident this was what I wanted to do as a job. Not wanting to go back to school again, I learned about Epicodus and felt like that was the perfect way to break into the tech field.</p>

      <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I graduated from Western Connecticut Statue University with a BA in Fine Art (BFA). I continue to enjoy art and appreciate what I learned, but my interest was always with computers.</p>
      <h3>Job Experience</h3>
        <p>I've worked as a wifi installation engineer for 3 years, configuring wifi coverage patterns in large facilities like hospitals. Beyond that I was in the service industry, either working the register or delivering food on my bicycle downtown.</p>
