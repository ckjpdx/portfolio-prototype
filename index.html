      <p>I've always loved computers and <strong>video games</strong>. (PC gamer for life). Besides that, I'm into the usual awesome things Portland has to offer: media that I enjoy and food that pleases my palette. The only thing outside of coding that I continuously strive to improve upon is being a decent person. I spend <em>a lot of time</em> considering the social and moral aspects of life and always try to keep an open mind.</p>
